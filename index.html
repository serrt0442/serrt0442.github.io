  <p><b> <font size="4" color="white" face="arial">For Honor is a competitive third-person melee fighting game mixing speed, strategy, and team play with visceral close range combat in multiplayer action. Experience the chaos, fury, and brutality of battle where you and your friends cut a bloody trail of carnage as brutal Vikings, deadly Knights, and cold-blooded Samurai.

The innovative Art of Battle system lets you feel the power of every strike, the strength of every impact, and the weight of the weapon in your hand. It is meant to deliver a feeling of really dueling without the sacrifice of accessibility and simplicity. The system was built using motion capture by real martial artists and professional stuntmen to give the battles realism not otherwise possible. Players can easily switch between three different stances in order to block an attack or strike an enemy. Watching the enemy closely to see which stance they switch to is key to defense and offense. This give the players a chance to plan their next move and ideally the next few as well. Players can also shift stances mid-swing and feint, in an attempt to trick opponents into shifting their guard.

There are three playable factions in For Honor and each one presents the story from their own point-of-view. Play through each one for a completely unique experience. The For Honor Story Campaign mode can be played solo or in 2 player co-op. Players will be thrust into the war raging with the other two factions. There is also a competitive multiplayer online mode that pits players against each other.</font></p>

  <h3><font color="white">Hero Types     <img src=https://78.media.tumblr.com/68e53eb5454ea339f6772dae74c353dc/tumblr_nq64f72bE31tutnjio1_500.gif width="300" height="150"  >        </h3>
  <p><font size="3" color='white' face="arial">Each of the three factions have their own heroes with a total of four playable heroes per faction. Each of the Heroes comes with their own set of skills, weapons, armor and fighting style and are grouped into one of four types. <font> 
  
  </p>Vanguards - These are well-balanced Heroes with good attack and defense capabilities. They also have great versatility.</p>
  
  </p>Assassins - This Hero type is swift and lethal. They have good offensive skills and are a good choice for duels.</p>
  
  </p>Heavies - These Heroes have the highest resistance to damage but their attacks are slower than the other types, although still deadly. They are best used to defend a capture point and exterminating AI enemies.</p>
  
  </p>Hybrids - Hybrids are a mix of the other three types, making them a little more difficult to master due to their unique use of tactics, but they are no less effective in killing for the player willing to make the effort.

  <h3><font color= black><font color="white">Should You Get This Game?</h3>
  
  
  
  <p> The short answer is yes imo, this game is very fun. But for honor also has a weird learning curve. it was many bad reviews on steam but just get the game and if you dont like it refund it. you are going to get trash talked no matter what game it is (because your a noob) but thats ok, happens in every game. also the twitch side of for honor is amazing. Setback is a great stream for all the for honor memes that you desire and wertie is a good memer too. if you have the money please try out this game (on pc get it on pc only thanks)  </p>

  <p> Samurai- The Samurai of the Dawn Empire, also known as The Chosen, is one of the three playable factions in For Honor. These people come from a land, far to the East and they tell a tale of a homeland and an Emperor that were lost to sea and fire during the last great cataclysm. Now, more than a millennia later the nomadic warriors roam no more and have rebuilt themselves in a new land with a new Emperor.</p>


</p> Viking- The Vikings, also known as The Warborn, are one of the three playable factions in For Honor. Previously thought to have vanished, the Vikings have returned - in great numbers - from across the sea. They have come to take new lands, plunder, expand the clans and reclaim their ancient homeland in the North. Hundreds of clans now dominate amidst the cold and icy tundra.</p>

</p>Knights- The Knights, also known as The Iron Legion, are one of the three playable factions in For Honor. It is their belief that many, if not all of the ancient ruins were built by their ancestors. The Knights had been scattered for centuries but have begun to reunite under a single banner, that of the Iron Legion. There are those still, however, who choose to gather their own "Legion", and their alliance with the Iron Legion is shaky at best. </p>

  <p> The Wardens are powerful, noble warriors dedicated to the defense of their land and their people. Striking a balance between defense and offense, wardens wear partial plate armor with chainmail and leather. Wardens wield massive two-handed longswords for slashing enemies and blocking attacks. Trained to be proud, loyal, and brilliant diplomats, the Wardens are expected to embody the highest values of Knighthood. Many set out to achieve this, few do.</p>

<div id="Raider" class="tabcontent">
  <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="topright">x</span>
  <h3><font color= "White">Raider</h3>  
  <p> Fighting with heavy two-handed axes, Raiders are always found at the forefront of the Viking horde, hacking through enemies crazy enough to stand in their way. They are clad in leather and iron rings, with their bodies covered by tattoos – souvenirs from past battles, which they bear proudly. These relentless warriors embody the Viking ideals: boundless bravery, spotless integrity, and unbridled passion. They know the moment of their death has already been chosen upon birth, so no Viking fears to follow their destiny. Of course, they all intend to bring as many foes with them as they can.</p>

  <h3><font color= "white">Kensei</h3>
  <p> The living incarnations of Bushidō, the samurai way of the warrior, or as close as one can get. Masters of multiple martial arts, they are trained from infancy to fight and die for their emperor or their fellow samurai without asking why. Kensei wear heavy armor and fight with the nodachi, a longer version of the katana that cleaves enemies in a few elegant and powerful strikes. Kensei spend their lives fighting and training as they strive to attain a level of perfection few other warriors can ever hope to achieve.</p>

  <h3><font color= "white">Conq</h3>  
  <p> Ex-prisoners and forced conscripts who have risen to the rank of elite soldier. Originally pressed into military service as sword fodder, those who are skilled enough to survive are promoted out of the rank and file and given heavy infantry training. They are heavily armored warriors, relying on a defensive style and their massive flails to whittle away at their opponent’s stamina until they fall under the Conquerors’ massive onslaught. Climbing from the lowest ranked to this prestigious role in the Knight’s forces, Conquerors have earned the respect of their peers through determination and feats of arms.</p>
